#What was changed:s
-UserController
  - Added **session reset** on login/register to avoid `419 Page Expired` errors caused by ghost sessions.
  - Forced Laravel to issue a **fresh session cookie** (`laravel_session`) on every successful login and register.
  - Added cookie cleanup on logout, so stale cookies won’t cause login loops.
-Login Blade:
  - Added success/error messages with styled alerts for better UX.
  - Improved consistency with Register page (shows messages clearly).
-Register Blade:
  - (Earlier change) Auto-redirects to timeline after successful register.
-Environment Config:
  - Ensured `.env` uses `SESSION_DRIVER=database` with correct session handling.
